			<h3 id="two">II. Writing Proofs Stochastically</h3>
			<p>
				Often, the first time you try to write a proof, you make some guesses that lead you down a blind alley. How nice would it be to be able to compute the probability that the path you’re taking goes nowehere? I'm not about to claim that this probability is always computable ahead of time. However, I think it's likely computable ad hoc, and in certain circumstances. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Suppose we were to construct a machine that "randomly" constructs a derivation tree given a sequence of rules and a sequent in some logic. My main questions in this direction are as follows:
				<ol type="a"> 
					<li><i>In which circumstances is the likelihood of a specific derivation having taken place computable?</i></li>
					<li><i>How can we learn from these probabilities-that is, if we adjust the likelihood of some derivation steps, can we make proofs more likely to appear as derivations?</i></li>
				</ol>

			<h3 id="three">III. A Graphical Representation of Formulas</h3>
			<p>
				This project is all about representing logical formulas with graphs, and characterizing the formula-representing graphs by structural constraints. The current focus is on the formulas of any logic built out of some number of parallel monoidal closed structures, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunched_logic" target="_blank">bunched implication logic</a>. At the moment, a faithful graph-theoretic representation of the multiplicative fragment of propositional bunched implication logic <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gzJ6Jwmryi0url60grpA3E993U1jqqeH/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">exists</a>, and the graphs it produces are characterized. The general case is still under construction, but looks promising.
			</p>

			<p>
				It was first noticed in the 70s that a faithful representation of propositions in classical propostional logic could be represented with simple graphs whose vertices were labelled by propositions. This was later used in [1] to give a combinatorial account of classical propositional logic's proof theory, which was extended in [2] to full classical predicate logic and in [3] to several modal logics.
			</p>

			<p>
				To give a flavour of the work involved, what follows is a brief account of the representation of classical propositional formulas that appears in [1]. Given a formula \(\varphi\) grammatically constructed from the rules
				\[
					A,B ::= p \in \mathbf{Prop} \mid \bar p \mid A \wedge B \mid A \vee B,
				\]
				the simple graph \([\![\varphi]\!]\) associated with \(\varphi\) is defined recursively as follows: For any literal \(a\),
				\[
					[\![a]\!] = (\{v^{(a)}\}, \emptyset)
				\]
				is the graph with a single vertex labelled "\(a\)". For any formulas \(A,B\),
				\[
					[\![A \vee B]\!] = [\![A]\!] \sqcup [\![B]\!]
				\] 
				is given by disjoint union, and 
				\[
					[\![A \wedge B]\!] = [\![A]\!] |\!| [\![B]\!] := [\![A]\!] \sqcup [\![B]\!] + \{v \frown w \mid v \in [\![A]\!], w \in [\![B]\!]\}
				\]
				is given by a disjoint union followed by fully connecting vertices between the two components (notice that \(|\!|\) and \(\sqcup\) are associative and commutative operations!). For example, \([\![q \wedge (\bar q \vee p)\wedge r]\!]\) is the following graph.
			</p>

					<img src="images/cograph_example.png" />
				</div>
				Any graph constructed from a formula in this manner is called a <i>cograph</i>. This representation of classical propositional formulas is <i>faithful</i>, in the sense that no two inequivalent formulas construct the same graph (with labelling). Cographs are precisely the <i>\(N\)-free</i> grphs, where graph is called <i>\(N\)-free</i> when no induced subgraph on four vertices has exactly three edges.
			</p>

			<p>
				A slightly different graphical representation is used in [4] for the multiplicative fragment of intuitionistic propositional logic, where a combinatorial proof theory is also developed. In a talk I attended last year, given by Willem Heijltes and about [4], he mentioned that characterizing the graphs representing their formulas was a huge pain. While the ultimate aim of combinatorial proof theory is to...well...give a combinatorial account of proof theory, I think the faithful representation of formulas and the characterization of their graphs is itself an interesting and meaningful problem. At the very least, I hope that the project allows our friends in the combinatorial proof theory department to suffer just a little less.
			</p>

				This project is mostly for-fun, so it isn't worked on actively all the time. I encourage anyone interested to get in contact and contribute. More information on the combinatorial proofs program can be found <a href="http://boole.stanford.edu/~dominic/proofs-without-syntax/">here</a>.
