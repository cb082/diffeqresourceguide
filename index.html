			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/academics/science/math-computer-science" target="_blank">Computer Science Department of Bucknell University</a>.
				My passions are STEM education, the mathematical foundations of programming, and youth outreach in math/computer science. 
				I used to be an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/academics/science/math-computer-science" target="_blank">Mathematics and Computer Science Department of St. Mary's College of California</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I completed my PhD in 2023 as a part of the <a href="http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/" target="_blank">PPLV group</a> in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department of University College London</a>. 
				I had the privilege of being supervised by <a href="https://www.alexandrasilva.org/#/main.html" target="_blank">Alexandra Silva</a> and <a href="http://jurriaan.me/" target="_blank">Jurriaan Rot</a>.
				The subject of my thesis, <a href="thesis.pdf" target="_blank"><i>Coalgebraic Completeness Theorems for Effectful Process Algebras</i></a>, was a generalization of the completeness theorem for Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (GKAT), presented by Smolka et al. in 2019, to any process algebra consisting of action sequencing, an algebraic effect, and basic recursion.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am generally intereted in the algebraic, coalgebraic, and logical foundations of program semantics.
				My research aims to apply the theory of iteration, monad presentations, and logics for coinductive relations to process algebra.
				Nonstandard approaches to program semantics are also highly entertaining to me (I think a lot about fractals and making music with transition systems). 
			</p>
			<p>
				If we happen share interests, please write! 
				I'm always happy to make a new pen pal.

				Outside of theoretical computer science, I <a href="https://toddtoddtodd.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">make electronic music</a>, think about rescue dogs, and do a bit of climbing.

						In September of last year, Tobias Kappé found a hole in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30044-8_12" target="_blank">the completeness proof for skip-free GKAT that we published at ESOP 2023</a> along with Alexandra Silva.
						Thankfully, we had another completeness proof (using a different technique) in our pocket, so we knew that the result was still correct, at least. 
						But, we wanted to fix the proof technique we used <i>in that paper</i>, so we went to work.
						Soon after, we produced the completeness proof that appeared in <a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10185006/" target="_blank">my thesis</a>.
						We just put a new and improved, polished and presentable version of the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11301" target="_blank">on arXiv</a>.
						The proof ended up being much harder (and even more interesting) than we thought.
