			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/academics/science/math-computer-science" target="_blank">Computer Science Department of St. Mary's College of California</a>.
				My passions are STEM education, the mathematical foundations of programming language theory, and youth outreach in computer science. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I completed my PhD in 2023 as a part of the <a href="http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/" target="_blank">PPLV group</a> in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department of University College London</a>. 
				I had the privilege of being supervised by <a href="https://www.alexandrasilva.org/#/main.html" target="_blank">Alexandra Silva</a> and <a href="http://jurriaan.me/" target="_blank">Jurriaan Rot</a>.
				The subject of my thesis, <i>Coalgebraic Completeness Theorems for Effectful Process Algebras</i>, was a generalization of the completeness theorem for Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (GKAT), presented by Smolka et al. in 2019, to any process algebra consisting of action sequencing, an algebraic effect, and basic recursion.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am generally intereted in the algebraic, coalgebraic, and logical foundations of program semantics.
				My resarch aims to apply the theory of iteration, monad presentations, and logics for coinductive relations to process algebra.
				Nonstandard approaches to program semantics are also highly entertaining to me. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If we happen share interests, please write! 
				I'm always happy to make a new pen pal. 
			</p>

			<p>Below is a picture of me in a Frodo costume at 11 years old.</p>

			<p>
				Aside from theoretical computer science, I think a lot about music technology, dog rescue, and bouldering.
