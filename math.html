				At the moment, I am generally interested in the algebra-coalgebra interactions found in computer science, but I am also interested in model theory and categories.

				<li>
					(07/2021)
					<i>
					How to write a coequation</i>, coauthored with 
					Fred Dahlqvist at University College London. 
					This fits into CALCO's new "pearls" submission category.
					It is part historical survey, part tutorial, and part reference resource. 
					Basically, coequations are very useful, despite their perceived austerity, and we just wanted to make them a little more accessible to 
					the community.
					<b>[To appear in <a href="https://www.coalg.org/calco-mfps2021/calco/" target="_blank">CALCO 2021</a>]</b>

					<i><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08074" target="_blank">
					On Star Expressions and Coalgebraic Completeness Theorems</a></i>, coauthored with 
					Jurriaan Rot at Radboud University and 
					Alexandra Silva at University College London. 
					This paper is a universal coalgebraic take on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12740" target="_blank">the recent significant step</a> 
					made by Clemens Grabmayer and Wan Fokkink towards solving a famous problem of Robin Milnor's. 
					It also contains general accounts of two different approaches to proving coalgebraic completeness theorems found in the literature.

					(02/2021)
					<i><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08286" target="_blank">
					Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests: Coequations, Coinduction, and Completeness</a></i>, coauthored with 
					Tobias Kapp√© and Dexter Kozen at Cornell University, and my supervisor Alexandra Silva at University College London. 
					This was a follow-up to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05920" target="_blank">original paper</a> on GKAT, giving a final coalgebra 
					semantics to both the original axiomatisation as well as an axiomatisation for GKAT without the early termination axiom.

				<li>
					(12/2019)
					<i><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12153" target="_blank">
					Concrete Barriers to Quantifier Elimination in Finite-Dimensional C*-algebras</a></i>, coauthored with Christopher Eagle at the University of Victoria. This was the culmination of what was essentially an undergraduate thesis, funded by a Jamie Cassels Undergraduate Research Award. <b>[Appears in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/malq.201900041" target="_blank">Mathematical Logic Quarterly</a>]</b>

			<h3>Notes</h3>
			<list>
				<li>
					<i><a href="T Schmid - Toposes, Sets, and Cohen Forcing, an Overview.pdf" target="_blank">
						Toposes, Sets, and Cohen Forcing</a></i>, a writeup of my masters' project, supervised by Stevo Todorcevic at the University of Toronto. It essentially follows the approach to proving the independence of the continuum hypothesis taken in the classic textbook <i>Sheaves in Geometry and Logic</i> by Saunders MacLane and Leke Moerdijk, but as simple as I could manage and with a number of peripheral comments.
