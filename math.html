						A (Co)algebraic Framework for Ordered Processes
					</a></i>
					[Submitted.]
					<div class="abstract"><b class="hoverreq">(Hover for abstract)</b><br />
						A recently published paper (Schmid, Rozowski, Silva, and Rot, 2022) offers a (co)algebraic framework for studying processes with algebraic branching structures and recursion operators. The framework captures Milner's algebra of regular behaviours (Milner, 1984) but fails to give an honest account of a closely related calculus of probabilistic processes (Stark and Smolka, 1999). We capture Stark and Smolka's calculus by giving an alternative framework, aimed at studying a family of ordered process calculi with inequationally specified branching structures and recursion operators. We observe that a recent probabilistic extension of guarded Kleene algebra with tests (Rozowski, Kozen, Kappe, Schmid, Silva, 2022) is a fragment of one of our calculi, along with other examples. We also compare the intrinsic order in our process calculi with the notion of similarity in coalgebra.

						Presenting with Quantitative Inequational Theories

					<div class="abstract"><b class="hoverreq">(Hover for abstract)</b><br />
						It came to the attention of myself and the coauthors of (S., Rozowski, Silva, Rot, 2022) that a number of process calculi can be obtained by algebraically presenting the branching structure of the transition systems they specify. Labelled transition systems, for example, branch into sets of transitions, terms in the free semilattice generated by the transitions. Interpreting equational theories in the category of sets has undesirable limitations, and we would like to have more examples of presentations in other categories. In this brief article, I discuss monad presentations in the category of partially ordered sets and monotone maps. I focus on quantitative monads, namely free modules over ordered semirings, and give sufficient conditions for one of these to lift a monad on the category of sets.

						This paper introduces a family of processa algebras in one parameter: the algebraic theory that presents the branching structure of the processes algebraized. We also cut out nonstandard analogues of regular expressions from a large chunk of these process algebras.

						This fits into CALCO's new "pearls" submission category. It is part historical survey, part tutorial, and part reference resource. Basically, coequations are very useful, despite their perceived austerity, and we just wanted to make them a little more accessible to the community.

					<div class="abstract"><b class="hoverreq">(Hover for abstract)</b><br />
						This was the culmination of what was essentially an undergraduate thesis, funded by a Jamie Cassels Undergraduate Research Award. The primary result is that minimal projectivity and unitary conjugation are definable in the language of C*-algebras, but are inexpressible without quantifiers.
						Furthermore, adding them to the language is sufficient for quantifier eliination in finite-dimensional C*-algberas (and in fact, only minimal projectivity is needed for the matrix algebras).

							This is a writeup of my masters' project, supervised by Stevo Todorcevic at the University of Toronto. It essentially follows the approach to proving the independence of the continuum hypothesis taken in the classic textbook <i>Sheaves in Geometry and Logic</i> by Saunders MacLane and Leke Moerdijk, but as simple as I could manage and with a number of peripheral comments.
