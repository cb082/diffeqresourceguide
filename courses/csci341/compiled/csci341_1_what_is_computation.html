<h1>What is <i>Computation</i>?</h1>

<p>
    In your intro programming course, you might have been asked to reflect on what exactly counts as <i>computation</i>.
    Computer science is ostensibly all about it, and it's no secret we've been <i>doing it</i> going back at least to antiquity.
</p>
<div class="figure">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Abacus_%28PSF%29.png/1920px-Abacus_%28PSF%29.png" />
    Abacuses are known to have been in use in Sumer at least as early as 2300 BC. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)
</div>
<p>
    There are plenty of computer scientists around, many of whom even happen to be kinda smart.
    You might think we would have figured out what computation is by now!
    But it turns out that giving a precise definition to the word "computation" is very difficult for much the same reason that Biologists have trouble defining the word "life".
    It's kind of an <i>I know it when I see it</i> kind of situation.
    The fact of the matter is that computation appears in nature in a variety of different, seemingly unrelated ways. 
</p>
<div class="figure">
    <img src="../imgs/slimemolds.png" />
    Slime molds have been known to be able to remember unfavourable lab conditions and even solve optimization problems, even though they don't have neurons. 
    They must be computing somehow... but they lack the usual computational mechanisms for actually carrying out calculations! (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-yzSiq_fgQ0sMvp1z8lJB6mCxIyiDPg/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">source</a>)
</div>
<p>
    One answer to the question of computation is that <i>computation is what computers do</i>.
    This is an unhelpful answer in general, because there are plenty of things that can perform computations that are not computers (for example, <i>you</i>).
    And perhaps more importantly, this answer leaves us wondering what a <i>computer</i> is...
</p>

<h2>What is a computer?</h2>
<p>
    It's important to stress at this point that the questions we are asking are at this point kind of philosophical, since mechanical computers have been around forever.
    We've already mentioned the abacus.
    There were also some very early attempts at building a mechanical calculator, like this one designed by Gottfreid Leibniz:
</p>
<div class="figure">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Leibniz_Stepped_Reckoner_drawing.png" />
    The "Stepped Reckoner" could perform basic arithmetic using a drum and some gears. (<a src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepped_reckoner">Wikipedia</a>)
</div>
<p>
    The original meaning of the term <i>computer</i> actually did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_(occupation)">refer to a person (typically women)</a>, who would perform calculations in a variety of different contexts. 
    But the computations preformed by computers like the abacus and stepped reckoner, and even for human computers as well, are of a specific and numerical form: numbers, the arcs of trajectories, etc.
    Your phone can do a whole lot more than that! 
    Your phone is what is known as a <i>general purpose computer</i>, since the type of computations it performs can vary by need.
</p>
<p>
    The first appearance of what resembles a general purpose computer was theorized and developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> in the wake of the Industrial Revolution of England in the 19th century.

</div>
<p>
    
    Thankfully, computer science was in good (mathematical) hands upon its birth in the early 20th century.
    Several working definitions of the word "computer" were proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a>, and several others.
