<div style="border: none; margin-bottom: -25px; padding: 0px; text-align: right;"><a href="../compiled/csci341_notes_1_12_silent_transitions.html"><span class="link"> \(\looparrowleft\) silent transitions</span></a></div><h1>Pumping Lemgths</h1>

<p>
    To summarize the whole situation so far in the course:
    \[
        \mathsf{TDFin}
        = \mathsf{DFin}
        = \mathsf{Fin}
        = \mathsf{Reg}
        = \mathsf{Fin}_\varepsilon
    \]
    This is to say that there are many models of computation to choose from when it comes to modelling decision procedures for regular languages.
    All of these are so expressive that even silent transitions can't escape \(\mathsf{Reg}\)!
    So is that it then?
    Regular languages are the end of the story?
</p>

<p>
    Well, actually, regular languages are just the beginning. 
    If you'll remember, from the <a href="csci341_notes_1_04_finite_and_infinite_languages.html" target="_blank">Finite and Infinite Languages notes</a>, we have already seen a language that didn't appear to have a total deterministic finite automaton associated with it:
    \[
        L_{a=b} = \{a^nb^n \mid n \in \mathbb N\} = \{\varepsilon, ab, aabb, aaabbb, \dots\}
    \]
    We were suspicious of the this language because its Brzozowski derivatives never loop back on themselves.
    But how do we <i>prove</i> that a particular language is not regular?
</p>

<p>
    It turns out that there are many ways to prove that a language is not regular (including calculating its Brzozowski derivatives, but that is beyond the scope of the course). 
    But one approach has a particular strength: it's a common technique that you will see all across the sciences!
    The slogan goes like this: Suppose that you have a collections of 'things', called \(X\). 
    And given a particular thing, call it \(y\), we want to prove that \(y \notin X\). 
    Then we must conjure up a property \(P\) such that every \(x \in X\) satisfies \(P\), but \(y\) does <i>not</i> satisfy \(P\). 
    This establishes that \(y \notin X\).
    In our case, \(X = \mathsf{Reg}\), \(x = L_{a=b}\), and the property \(P\) will have to do with something called a <i>pumping length</i>. 
</p>

<p>A lot of today has to do with paths of one sort or another. 
    As the saying goes, 
    <div class="figure">
        If one has a path, then life is good.
    </div>
    It is helpful to have a bit of terminology on our side.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Simple Paths)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A\) be an automaton. 
    A path in \(\mathcal A\),
    \[
    x_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} x_2 \xrightarrow{a_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{n-1}} x_{n}
    \]
    is called <i>simple</i> if \(x_i \neq x_j\) for all \(0 \le i < j < n\).
    We say that \(\mathcal A\) <i>is a path</i> if it is 
</div>

<p>
    The story as it unfolds here is much better <i>done</i> than <i>told</i>, so why don't we just <i>do it</i>?
</p>

<h2>Necessary Cycles</h2>

<div class="individual-exercise">
    <b>(Words)</b>
    Let \(A = \{0, 1\}\) and consider the language \(L_{\le 3} = \{w \in A^* \mid |w| \le 3\}\).
    Attempt to write down all of the words in \(L_{\le 3}\). 
    How many are there?
    Are there finitely many or infinitely many words in \(L_{\le 502332}\)?
    Or in \(L_{\le n}\) for some fixed \(n \in \mathbb N\)?
</div>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Cycle)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) be an automaton. 
    A <i>cycle</i> in \(\mathcal A\) is a path 
    \[
        x_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} x_2 \xrightarrow{a_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{n-1}} x_n
    \]
    such that \(x_1 = x_n\). 
    Each of the \(x_i\) is said to <i>appear</i> in the cycle.
    A cycle is <i>simple</i> if furthermore, \(x_i \neq x_j\) for all \(0 < i < j < n\) (in other words, there are no other repetitions than \(x_1 = x_n\)).
</div>

<p>
    When all an automaton consists of is a (simple) cycle, then we are going to simply call it a (simple) cycle.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Finding Cycles)</b>
    Consider the state diagram below. 
    <div class="figure">
        <img src="../imgs/cycles.svg" />
        An automaton \(\mathcal A\) with states \(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3\) with a bunch of different cycles!
    </div>
    Find all of the simple cycles in \(\mathcal A\).
    Make note of all of the simple cycles in which \(x_0\) appears (you can use this example later).
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Finite with Cycles)</b>
    Draw an automaton \(\mathcal A\) with a state \(x\) such that
    <ol>
        <li>\(x\) appears in a cycle</li>
        <li>\(\mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\) is finite</li>
    </ol>
    What can you tell me about \(\mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\)?
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(With Better Cycles?)</b>
    Draw an automaton \(\mathcal A\) with a state \(x\) such that 
    <ol>
        <li>\(x\) appears in a cycle</li>
        <li>\(x\) is accepting</li>
    </ol>
    What can you tell me about \(\mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\)?
    In particular, how many words does it have?
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Necessary Cycles)</b>
    Draw an automaton \(\mathcal A\) with a state \(x\) such that for some nonempty word \(w = a_1a_2\cdots a_n\) (you get to decide which), 
    \[\mathcal L((w)^*) \subseteq \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\]
</div>

<h2>Necessary Lassos</h2>

<p>
    Ok... so we were dealing with automata and paths and cycles and stuff... where is this going?
    ... around in circles! Eventually.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Lasso)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) be an automaton. 
    A <i>lasso</i> in \(\mathcal A\) is a path 
    \[
        x_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} x_2 \xrightarrow{a_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{n-1}} x_n
    \]
    such that \(x_m = x_n\) for some \(1\le m < n\) (note that in particular this means \(1 < n\)).
    Each of the \(x_i\) above is said to <i>appear</i> in the lasso, and \(x_1\) is said to <i>start</i> the lasso.
    A lasso is <i>simple</i> if it is a simple path that is followed by a simple cycle.
</div>

<p>
    When all an automaton consists of is a (simple) lasso, then we are going to simply call it a (simple) lasso.
</p>

<p>
    An easy consequence of this definition is that every cycle is a lasso.
    But the converse is not true. 
</p>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Capturing the Lasso)</b>
    Draw a lasso that is not a cycle. 
    Is every simple cycle a simple lasso?
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Finding Cycles)</b>
    Consider the state diagram below. 
    <div class="figure">
        <img src="../imgs/cycles.svg" />
        An automaton \(\mathcal A\) with states \(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3\) with a bunch of different lassos!
    </div>
    Find all of the simple lassos in \(\mathcal A\) that start with \(x_0\) (and are not cycles).
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Unnecessary Lassos)</b>
    Draw a lasso \(\mathcal A\) with a state \(x\) such that 
    <ol>
        <li>\(\mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\) is finite</li>
        <li>\(x\) starts a lasso</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="individual-exercise">
    <b>(Necessary Lassos)</b>
    Prove the following statement using pictures to illustrate your reasoning:
    let \(\mathcal A\) be a finite automaton with a state \(x\), and let \(L = \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\). 
    If \(L\) is infinite, then \(x\) starts a lasso.
</div>

<h2>Pumps</h2>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Pump)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) be an automaton. 
    A <i>pump</i> in \(\mathcal A\) is a path 
    \[
        x_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} x_2 \xrightarrow{a_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{n-1}} x_n
    \]
    such that \(x_m = x_k\) for some \(1\le m < k \le n\) (again, \(1 < n\)) <b>and \(x_n \in F\)</b>.
    Each of the \(x_i\) above is said to <i>appear</i> in the pump, and \(x_1\) is said to <i>start</i> the pump.

    <ul>
        <li>
            The sub-path \(x_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{m-1}} x_{m}\) is called the <i>head</i> of the pump.
        </li>
        <li>
            The sub-path \(x_m \xrightarrow{a_m} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{k-1}} x_{k}\) is called the <i>body</i> of the pump.
        </li>
        <li>
            The sub-path \(x_k \xrightarrow{a_k} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{n-1}} x_{n}\) is called the <i>tail</i> of the pump.
        </li>
    </ul>
    That is, 
    \[
        x_1 \mathrel{\overbrace{\xrightarrow{a_1} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{m-1}} }^{\text{head}}}
        x_m \mathrel{\overbrace{\xrightarrow{a_m} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{k-1}} }^{\text{body}}}
        x_k \mathrel{\overbrace{\xrightarrow{a_k} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{n-1}} }^{\text{tail}}}
        x_n
    \]
    A pump is <i>simple</i> if every cycle it contains is simple.
</div>

<p>
    An easy consequence of the definition is that every cycle and every lasso is a pump.
</p>

<div class="individual-exercise">
    <b>(Lil Pump in the Country)</b>
    Explain why every cycle is a lasso and every lasso is a pump.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Loop-de-loop)</b>
    Draw a pump that is not a lasso.
    Is every simple lasso a simple pump?
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Find the Pump)</b>
    Consider the state diagram below. 
    <div class="figure">
        <img src="../imgs/cycles.svg" />
        An automaton \(\mathcal A\) with states \(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3\) with a bunch of different pumps!
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>Find all of the simple pumps in \(\mathcal A\) that start with \(x_0\) (and are not lassos).</li>
        <li>Verify that every path of length \(\ge 4\) starting from \(x_0\) is a pump.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<h2>Pumping Lengths</h2>

<p>
    Something happened in that last exercise.
    Did you catch it?
    There was a particular number, namely \(4\), where any path of length at least \(4\) contained a pump.
    This number is pretty special, so we're going to write it down in a definition.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Pumping Lengths for Automata)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A\) be an automaton (not necessarily finite) with a state \(x\). 
    A number \(\ell \in \mathbb N\) is called a <i>pumping length for \(x\)</i> if every path of length \(\ge \ell\) starting from \(x\) and ending in an accepting state is a pump.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Finding Pumping Lengths)</b>
    Find a pumping length for each state in each of the following automata.
    <ol>
        <li><div class="figure">
            <img src="../imgs/kleenealgebraeg.svg" />
        </div></li>
        <li><div class="figure">
            <img src="../imgs/01then0.svg" />
        </div></li>
        <li><div class="figure">
            <img src="../imgs/reach.svg" />
        </div></li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>
    We haven't said explicitly that every state in every automaton has a pumping length.
    This is kind of the point! 
    Not every one will!
</p>

<div class="lemma">
    <b>(Pumping, for Automata)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A\) be a finite automaton with a state \(x\). 
    Then \(x\) has a pumping length.
</div>

<div class="problem">
    <b>(Finite, Pumped)</b>
    Prove the Pumping Lemma for Automata, i.e., that for any finite automaton \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) and any state \(x \in Q\), there is at least one \(\ell\) such that \(\ell\) is a pumping length for \(x\).
</div>

<p>
    This establishes that pumping lengths exist for finite automata (in fact, you just wrote one down explicitly for each finite automaton!).
    Now what does this have to do with languages?
    There is also a notion of pumping length for languages.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Pumping Lengths for Languages)</b>
    Let \(L \subseteq A^*\) be a language.
    A number \(\ell \in \mathbb N\) is a <i>pumping length for \(L\)</i> if for any word \(w \in L\) such that \(|w| \ge \ell\), there exist three words \(u,p,v \in A^*\) that satisfy the following properties:
    <ol>
        <li>The word \(p\), called the <i>body</i>, is nonempty \[p \neq \varepsilon\]</li>
        <li>Together with the body, the words \(u\) and \(v\), called the <i>head</i> and <i>tail</i> respectively, satisfy \[w = upv\]</li>
        <li>The length of the head and body does not exceed \(\ell\), i.e., \[|up| \le \ell\]</li>
        <li>For any \(k \in \mathbb N\), we can "pump up \(p\) \(k\) times", \[up^kv \in L\] </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>
    For example, \(\ell = 1\) is a pumping length for \(a^*\). 
    This is because for any word \(w \in \mathcal L(a^*)\), that word must be of the form \(w = a^n\) for some \(n > 0\).
    If we take \(p = a\), \(u = \varepsilon\), \(v = a^{n-1}\), then 
    <ol>
        <li>\(p = a \neq \varepsilon\)</li>
        <li>\(w = a^n = \varepsilon a a^{n-1}\)</li>
        <li>\(|up| = |\varepsilon a| = |a| = 1 \le \ell\)</li>
        <li>for any \(k \in \mathbb N\), \(up^kv = \varepsilon a^k a^{n-1} = a^{k + n - 1} \in \mathcal L(a^*)\)</li>
    </ol>
    Note that in order for \(\ell\) to be a pumping length, we need to show that <i>for any \(w\)</i> that is longer than \(\ell\) characters, <i>there exists</i> a breaking-up of \(w\) into \(upv\) <i>such that</i> properties 1.-4. hold. 
    This is a universal-existential statement: it says that \(u,p,v\) depend on \(w\), and that \(w\) can vary.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Finding some Pumping Lengths)</b>
    Find a pumping length for each of the following languages. 
    <ol>
        <li>\(L_1 = \mathcal L(a^* + b^*)\)</li>
        <li>\(L_2 = \mathcal L(a^*b^*)\)</li>
        <li>\(L_3 = \mathcal L((ab)^*)\)</li>
        <li>\(L_4 = \{\varepsilon, ab, ba, aab\}\)</li>
        <li>The language \(L_5 = \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x_0)\) where \(\mathcal A\) is the automaton

                <img src="../imgs/reach.svg" />
            </div>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="hint">
        Use the Antimirov automaton if you need some direction.
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    In the last part of that exercise, you probably discovered the following fact.
</p>

<div class="lemma">
    <b>(Pumping Lengths Coincide)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A\) be a finite automaton with a state \(x\), and let \(\ell \in \mathbb N\) be any number.
    Then \(\ell\) is a pumping length for \(\mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\) if and only if \(\ell\) is a pumping length for \(x\).
</div>

<p>
    Putting all of the above together, we arrive at the following theorem (although the common name for it includes the word "lemma")!
</p>

<div class="theorem">
    <b>(Pumping, for Languages)</b>
    Let \(L \in \mathsf{Reg}\) be a regular language. 
    Then a pumping length exists for \(L\).
