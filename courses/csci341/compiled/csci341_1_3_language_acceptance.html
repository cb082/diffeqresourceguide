<h1>Language Acceptance</h1>

<p>
    Today, we are going to return to the idea behind a <i>solution space</i>, which consisted of all of the sequences of legal moves that brought our puzzles into a "winning configuration".
    Just like how sequences of legal moves get abstracted to <i>words</i>, solution spaces are abstracted to <i>languages</i>.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Language)</b>
    Let \(A\) be a set of input symbols. 
    A <i>language from \(A\)</i> is a set of words from \(A\).
    That is, a language is a subset \(L \subseteq A^*\).
</div>

<p>
    The "winning configurations" of automata are the <i>accepting states</i>: in the definition of an automaton \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\), these are the states \(x \in F \subseteq Q\). 
    So the "solution space" of an automaton is, so to speak, the sequences of input letters that transition whichever state you start from to an accepting state.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Language Acceptance)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) be an automaton, \(x \in Q\) be a state, and \(w \in A^*\) be a word from \(A\).
    Then \(w\) is <i>accepted</i> (or <i>recognized</i>) <i>by \(x\)</i> if there is an accepting state \(y \in F\) such that \(y \in \delta(x, w)\).
    The word \(w\) is <i>rejected by \(x\)</i> if it is not accepted by \(x\).

    The <i>language accepted</i> (or <i>decided</i>) <i>by \(x\)</i> is the set of words accepted by \(x\),
    \[
        \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x) = \big\{ w \in A^* \mid \text{\(x\) accepts \(w\)}  \big\}
    \]
    If \(\mathcal A\) is clear from context, we will just write \(\mathcal L(x)\) instead of \(\mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\).
</div>

<p>
    A common turn of phrase you will see written is the statement "\(x\) accepts the language \(L\)". 
    What this means is that \(L = \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\).
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note.</b> There are two common mistakes you are going to make at least a few times:
    the first one is to say that "an <i>automaton</i> accepts a language \(L \subseteq A^*\)". Automata do not accept languages, states do.
    Remember: states are programs, automata are the machines that can run them.
</p>
<p>
    The second mistake is to say that a state \(x \in Q\) accepts a language \(L \subseteq A^*\) if every \(w \in L\) is accepted by \(x\). 
    This is equivalent to saying that \(\mathcal L(\mathcal A, x) \subseteq L\), not \(\mathcal L(\mathcal A, x) = L\)!
    The terminology "\(x\) <i>decides</i> \(L\)" is usually much clearer, but the standard literature usually uses the word "accept" for historical reasons... ðŸ™„
</p>

<p>
    <b>Notation.</b> Recall that, given two sets \(X\) and \(Y\), we are going to write \(X \setminus Y\) for the set of elements of \(X\) that are not in \(Y\).
    Formally, 
    \(
        X \setminus Y = \{x \in X \mid x \notin Y\}
    \).    
</p>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Accept and Reject)</b>
    Show that a state \(x\) of an automaton \(\mathcal A\) accepts (decides) a language \(L \subseteq A^*\) if both of the following statements are true:
    <ol>
        <li>for any \(w \in L\), \(x\) accepts \(w\)</li>
        <li>for any \(w \in A^* \setminus L\), \(x\) rejects \(w\)</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="problem">
    <b>(Let 'em Cook)</b>
    For each of the following languages \(L_i \subseteq A^*\) below, design an automaton \(\mathcal A_i = (Q_i, A_i, \delta_i, F_i)\) with a state \(x \in Q_i\) such that \(x\) accepts \(L_i\).
    <ol>
        <li>\(L_1 = \{a, aa, aaa\}\)</li>
        <li>\(L_2 = \{w \in A^* \mid \text{\(w\) ends with \(b\)}\}\)</li>
        <li>\(L_3 = \{w \in A^* \mid \text{\(w\) has an even number of \(a\)'s}\}\)</li>
        <li>\(L_4 = \{w \in A^* \mid \text{\(w\) has \(3k+1\) \(a\)'s for some \(k \ge 0\)}\}\)</li>
    </ol>
    For each of these languages, if you drew a nondeterministic or partial automaton, try to also draw a total deterministic one (include both in your write-up).
</div>

<!--Section-->
<h2>The Brzozowski Construction</h2>
<p>
    We defined languages abstractly, as arbitrary sets of words over an alphabet. 
    But then we talked about languages <i>accepted by states of automata</i>.
    Are these the same?
    In other words, is every language the language accepted by some automaton?
    The answer to this question is "yes", and the construction is easy to write down. 
    The definition below takes a bit of patience, so read it a few times and really try to convince yourself it works.
</p>

<p>
    The basic idea behind this section is that the <i>set of all languages</i> is the state space of an automaton.
    That is, we take the states of the automaton to be languages, and the transitions of the automaton to be transitions between languages.
    These transitions are called <i>Brzozowski derivatives"</i>.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(<a href="https://www.wikipedia.com/en/Brzozowski" target="_blank">Brzozowski</a> Derivatives)</b>
    Let \(A\) be a set of input letters and let \(a \in L\).
    Given a language \(L \subseteq A^*\), we define the <i>\(a\)-derivative of \(L\)</i> to be the set 
    \[
        a^{-1} L = \big\{ w \in A^*  \mid a\ w \in L \big\}
    \]
    In other words, \(a^{-1} L\) is the set of words \(w\) such that adding \(a\) to the beginning of \(w\) produces a word in \(L\). 
</div>

<p>
    Remember that we want to define an automaton where the languages are the states.
    This means that we want to think of <i>languages as programs</i> (because they are states and states are programs).
    The program that corresponds to a language \(L\) should really be thought of as "eating letters" as it runs, and accepting when it has nothing left to eat.
    In the simplest case, this is how you should imagine the \(a\)-derivative of just a word: \(a^{-1}\{a\ b\ c\} = \{b\ c\}\).
    For arbitrary languages, taking the \(a\)-derivative is what is meant by "eating all the \(a\)'s".
</p>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Where's the "b"?)</b>
    What is the \(b\)-derivative of the language \(\{a, aa, aaa\}\)?
</div>

<p>
    What is the \(a\)-derivative of the word \(a\) of length \(1\)?
    Well, remember that \(a^{-1}\ a\ w = w\) for any word \(w\).
    This includes the empty word, so 
    \[
        a^{-1}\{a\} = a^{-1}\{a\ \varepsilon\} = \{\varepsilon\}
    \]
    Observe that the language has a special property: one of the words has nothing left to eat!
</p>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Practice with Derivatives)</b>
    Compute \(a\)-derivative, \(b\)-derivative, and \(c\)-derivative of the language
    \[
        L = \{\varepsilon, aa, ba, cab, c, acab\}
    \]
</div>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(The Brzozowski Automaton)</b>
    The <i>Brzozowski automaton</i> is the automaton \(\mathcal A_{Brz} = (2^{A^*}, A, \delta, F)\) where 
    <ul>
        <li>\(2^{A^*} = \{L \mid L \subseteq A^*\}\)</li>
        <li>\(\delta = \{(L, a, a^{-1}L) \mid \text{\(a \in A\) and \(L \subseteq A^*\)}\}\)</li>
        <li>\(F = \{L \subseteq A^* \mid \varepsilon \in L\}\)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Unravelling a Language)</b>
    Draw a state diagram of all of the languages that are reachable from the language \(L = \{\varepsilon, aa, ba, cab, c, acab\}\) in the Brzozowski automaton (by taking derivatives). 
    Include all of the double-circles to indicate which languages are accepting states of the Brzozowski automaton.
    What language is accepted by \(L\)?
</div>

<div class="problem">
    <b>(Self-accepting)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A_{Brz}\) be the Brzozowski automaton and let \(L \in 2^{A^*}\).
    Come up with a general description of the language \(\mathcal L(\mathcal A_{Brz}, L)\) and prove that your description is always correct.
