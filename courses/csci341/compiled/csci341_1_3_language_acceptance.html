<h1>Languages and acceptance</h1>

<p>
    Today, we are going to return to the idea behind a <i>solution space</i>, which consisted of all of the sequences of legal moves that brought our puzzles into a "winning configuration".
    Just like how sequences of legal moves get abstracted to <i>words</i>, solution spaces are abstracted to <i>languages</i>.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Language)</b>
    Let \(A\) be a set of input symbols. 
    A <i>language from \(A\)</i> is a set of words from \(A\).
    That is, a language is a subset \(L \subseteq A^*\).
</div>

<p>
    The "winning configurations" of automata are the <i>accepting states</i>: in the definition of an automaton \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\), these are the states \(x \in F \subseteq Q\). 
    So the "solution space" of an automaton is, so to speak, the sequences of input letters that transition whichever state you start from to an accepting state.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Language Acceptance)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) be an automaton, \(x \in Q\) be a state, and \(w \in A^*\) be a word from \(A\).
    Then \(w\) is <i>accepted</i> (or <i>recognized</i>) <i>by \(x\)</i> if there is an accepting state \(y \in F\) such that \(y \in \delta(x, w)\).
    The word \(w\) is <i>rejected by \(x\)</i> if it is not accepted by \(x\).

    The <i>language accepted</i> (or <i>decided</i>) <i>by \(x\)</i> is the set of words accepted by \(x\),
    \[
        \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x) = \big\{ w \in A^* \mid \text{\(x\) accepts \(w\)}  \big\}
    \]
    If \(\mathcal A\) is clear from context, we will just write \(\mathcal L(x)\) instead of \(\mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\).
</div>

<p>
    A common turn of phrase you will see written is the statement "\(x\) accepts the language \(L\)". 
    What this means is that \(L = \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\).
</p>

<p>
    There are two common mistakes you are going to make at least a few times:
    the first one is to say that "an <i>automaton</i> accepts a language \(L \subseteq A^*\)". Automata do not accept languages, states do.
    Remember: states are programs, automata are the machines that can run them.
</p>
<p>
    The second mistake is to say that a state \(x \in Q\) accepts a language \(L \subseteq A^*\) if every \(w \in L\) is accepted by \(x\). 
    This is equivalent to saying that \(\mathcal L(\mathcal A, x) \subseteq L\), not \(\mathcal L(\mathcal A, x) = L\)!
    The terminology "\(x\) <i>decides</i> \(L\)" is usually much clearer, but the standard literature usually uses the word "accept" for historical reasons... ðŸ™„
</p>
<p>
    <b>Notation.</b> Recall that, given two sets \(X\) and \(Y\), we are going to write \(X \setminus Y\) for the set of elements of \(X\) that are not in \(Y\).
    Formally, 
    \(
        X \setminus Y = \{x \in X \mid x \notin Y\}
    \).    
    The set \(X \setminus Y\) is the <i>complement of \(Y\) in \(X\)</i>.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Accept and Reject)</b>
    Show that a state \(x\) of an automaton \(\mathcal A\) accepts (decides) a language \(L \subseteq A^*\) if both of the following statements are true:
    <ol>
        <li>for any \(w \in L\), \(x\) accepts \(w\)</li>
        <li>for any \(w \in A^* \setminus L\), \(x\) rejects \(w\)</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>
    In other words, if we were to start with a language \(L\) and try to come up with (design!) an automaton that accepts that language, then we also need to make sure that it rejects the complement of that language.
</p>

<div class="problem" id="letemcook">
    <b>(Let 'em Cook)</b>
    For each of the following languages \(L_i \subseteq A^*\) below, design an automaton \(\mathcal A_i = (Q_i, A_i, \delta_i, F_i)\) with a state \(x \in Q_i\) such that \(x\) accepts \(L_i\), and briefly explain why your automaton accepts \(L_i\).
    <ol>
        <li>\(L_1 = \{a, aa, aaa\}\)</li>
        <li>\(L_2 = \{w \in A^* \mid \text{\(w\) ends with \(b\)}\}\)</li>
        <li>\(L_3 = \{w \in A^* \mid \text{\(w\) has an even number of \(a\)'s}\}\)</li>
        <li>\(L_4 = \{w \in A^* \mid \text{\(w\) has \(3k+1\) many \(a\)'s for some \(k \ge 0\)}\}\)</li>
        <li>\(L_5 = \{w \in A^* \mid \text{\(w\) either has \(3k+1\) or \(3k + 2\) many \(a\)'s for some \(k \ge 0\)}\}\)</li>
    </ol>
    For each of these languages, if you drew a nondeterministic or partial automaton, try to also draw a total deterministic one (include both in your write-up).
</div>

<!--Section-->
<h2>Common descriptions of languages</h2>
<p>
    In the Let 'em Cook problem, we saw some descriptions of languages of the form 
    \[
        L = \{w \in A^* \mid \textit{(something that has to be true about \(w\))}\}
    \]
    As you have probably gathered so far, the sentence to the right of the \(\mid\) tells you explicitly when a particular \(w \in A^*\) is in \(L\) or not.
    This method of defining sets is called <i>set comprehension</i>, because you are giving a comprehensive description of which elements are in the set.
    Set comprehension is the most common way of describing sets of things in general, and it will come up frequently in this course.
</p>

<div class="example">
    <b>(One mod Two)</b>
    Consider the automaton below with input letters \(A = \{a, b\}\). 
    <div class="figure">
        <img src="../imgs/x_0_odd.svg" />
    </div>
    Starting from either \(x_0\) or \(x_1\), reading a \(b\) does not change whether or not the word is accepted/rejected.
    But reading an \(a\) switches from accepting to rejecting:
    starting from \(x_0\), reading any \(a\) will activate the accepting state, and from \(x_1\) reading an \(a\) will deactivate the accepting state.
    So, starting from \(x_0\), every word of the form 
    \[
        b^{n_1}\ a\ b^{n_2}\ a\ b^{n_3}\ a\ b^{n_4}
    \]
    is accepted, where here, \(n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4 \in \mathbb N\).
    But we also, the words of the form 
    \[
        b^{n_1}\ a\ b^{n_2}\ a\ b^{n_3}\ a\ b^{n_4}\ a\ b^{n_5}\ a\ b^{n_6}
    \]
    are accepted. 
    It's not feasible to write down the language accepted by \(x_0\) this way, so we use a set comprehension to capture the idea for us. 
    \[
        \mathcal L(x_0) = \{w \in A^* \mid \text{\(w\) contains \(2k + 1\) many \(a\)'s}\}
    \]
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(One More Than)</b>
    Using set comprehension, describe the language accepted by the state \(x_0\) in the automaton below.

<h2>States as literal programs</h2>

<p>
    Returning to the idea that states of automata are programs, we can implement an automaton reading a string of input letters in any programming language rather easily.
    Working from the code back to an automaton isn't always as easy.
</p>

<div class="problem">
    <b>(Pythonic Automaton I)</b>
    Consider the python program below.
    <div class="figure">
        <!-- <iframe src="https://replit.com/@tjws001/PythonicAutomatonI#main.py?embed=true"></iframe> -->
        <img src="../code/PythonicAutomatonI.png" />
        <a href="https://replit.com/@tjws001/PythonicAutomatonI#main.py">(External link to code.)</a>
    </div>
    This Python program corresponds to a state in an automaton \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) where \(A = \{0,1\}\).
    <ol>
        <li>
            Write down a transition table for \(\mathcal A\).
        </li>
        <li>
            Which state does the program correspond to?
        </li>
        <li>
            Using set comprehension, describe the language accepted by this state.
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Pythonic Automaton II)</b>
    Write a Python script in the same format as the Pythonic Automaton I that implements the state in the automaton \(\mathcal A_4\) you designed to accept \(L_4\) in <a href="#letemcook">Let 'em Cook</a>.
</div>

<div class="problem">
    <b>(Pythonic Automaton III)</b>
    Write a Python script in the same format as the Pythonic Automaton I that implements state \(s_1\) in <a href="./1_0_games_and_state_diagrams.html#firstpush" target="_blank">abstract state diagram (A)</a> from the games and puzzles section.
