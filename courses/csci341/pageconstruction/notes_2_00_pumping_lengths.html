<h1>Pumping Lemgths</h1>

<p>
    To summarize the whole situation so far in the course:
    \[
        \mathsf{TDFin}
        = \mathsf{DFin}
        = \mathsf{Fin}
        = \mathsf{Reg}
        = \mathsf{Fin}_\varepsilon
    \]
    This is to say that there are many models of computation to choose from when it comes to modelling decision procedures for regular languages.
    All of these are so expressive that even silent transitions can't escape \(\mathsf{Reg}\)!
    So is that it then?
    Regular languages are the end of the story?
</p>

<p>
    Well, actually, regular languages are just the beginning. 
    If you'll remember, from the <a href="csci341_notes_1_04_finite_and_infinite_languages.html" target="_blank">Finite and Infinite Languages notes</a>, we have already seen a language that didn't appear to have a total deterministic finite automaton associated with it:
    \[
        L_{a=b} = \{a^nb^n \mid n \in \mathbb N\} = \{\varepsilon, ab, aabb, aaabbb, \dots\}
    \]
    We were suspicious of the this language because its Brzozowski derivatives never loop back on themselves.
    But how do we <i>prove</i> that a particular language is not regular?
</p>

<p>
    It turns out that there are many ways to prove that a language is not regular (including calculating its Brzozowski derivatives, but that is beyond the scope of the course). 
    But one approach has a particular strength: it's a common technique that you will see all across the sciences!
    The slogan goes like this: Suppose that you have a collections of 'things', called \(X\). 
    And given a particular thing, call it \(y\), we want to prove that \(y \notin X\). 
    Then we must conjure up a property \(P\) such that every \(x \in X\) satisfies \(P\), but \(y\) does <i>not</i> satisfy \(P\). 
    This establishes that \(y \notin X\).
</p>

<p>
    In our case, \(X = \mathsf{Reg}\), \(x = L_{a=b}\), and the property \(P\) will have to do with something called a <i>pumping length</i>. 
</p>


<p>
    The story as it unfolds here is much better <i>done</i> than <i>told</i>, so why don't we just <i>do it</i>?

<h2>Necessary Cycles</h2>

<div class="individual-exercise">
    <b>(Words)</b>
    Let \(A = \{0, 1\}\) and consider the language \(L_{\le 3} = \{w \in A^* \mid |w| \le 3\}\).
    Attempt to write down all of the words in \(L_{\le 3}\). 
    How many are there?
    Are there finitely many or infinitely many words in \(L_{\le 502332}\)?
    Or in \(L_{\le n}\) for some fixed \(n \in \mathbb N\)?
</div>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Cycle)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) be an automaton. 
    A <i>cycle</i> in \(\mathcal A\) is a path 
    \[
        x_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} x_2 \xrightarrow{a_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{n-1}} x_n
    \]
    such that \(x_1 = x_n\). 
    Each of the \(x_i\) is said to <i>appear</i> in the cycle.
    A cycle is <i>simple</i> if furthermore, \(x_i \neq x_j\) for all \(0 < i < j < n\) (in other words, there are no other repetitions than \(x_1 = x_n\)).
</div>

<p>
    When all an automaton consists of is a (simple) cycle, then we are going to simply call it a (simple) cycle.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Finding Cycles)</b>
    Consider the state diagram below. 
    <div class="figure">

    Make note of all of the simple cycles in which \(x_0\) appears (you can use this example later).

    In particular, how many words does it have?

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Necessary Cycles)</b>
    Draw a few examples of an automaton \(\mathcal A\) with a state \(x\) such that for some nonempty word \(w = a_1a_2\cdots a_n\) (you get to decide which), 
    \[\mathcal L((w)^*) \subseteq \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\]
    What do they all have in common?
</div>

<h2>Necessary Lassos</h2>

<p>
    Ok... so we were dealing with automata and paths and cycles and stuff... where is this going?
    ... around in circles! Eventually.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Lasso)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) be an automaton. 
    A <i>lasso</i> in \(\mathcal A\) is a path 
    \[
        x_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} x_2 \xrightarrow{a_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{n-1}} x_n
    \]
    such that \(x_m = x_n\) for some \(1\le m < n\).
    Each of the \(x_i\) above is said to <i>appear</i> in the lasso, and \(x_1\) is said to <i>start</i> the lasso.
    A lasso is <i>simple</i> if furthermore, \(x_i \neq x_j\) for all \(m < i < j < n\) (in other words, there are no other repetitions than \(x_m = x_n\)).
</div>

<p>
    When all an automaton consists of is a (simple) lasso, then we are going to simply call it a (simple) lasso.
</p>

<p>
    An easy consequence of this definition is that every cycle is a lasso.
    But the converse is not true. 
</p>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Capturing the Lasso)</b>
    Draw a lasso that is not a cycle. 
    Is every simple cycle a simple lasso?
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Finding Cycles)</b>

<div class="problem">
    <b>(Necessary Lassos)</b>

    let \(\mathcal A\) be a finite automaton with a state \(x\), and let \(L = \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\). 
    If \(L\) is infinite, then \(x\) starts a lasso.
</div>

<h2>Pumps</h2>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Pump)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) be an automaton. 
    A <i>pump</i> in \(\mathcal A\) is a path 
    \[
        x_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} x_2 \xrightarrow{a_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{n-1}} x_n
    \]
    such that \(x_m = x_k\) for some \(1\le m < k \le n\).
    Each of the \(x_i\) above is said to <i>appear</i> in the pump, and \(x_1\) is said to <i>start</i> the pump.

    <ul>
        <li>
            The sub-path \(x_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{m-1}} x_{m}\) is called the <i>head</i> of the pump.
        </li>
        <li>
            The sub-path \(x_m \xrightarrow{a_m} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{k-1}} x_{k}\) is called the <i>body</i> of the pump.
        </li>
        <li>
            The sub-path \(x_k \xrightarrow{a_k} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{n-1}} x_{n}\) is called the <i>tail</i> of the pump.
        </li>
    </ul>
    That is, 
    \[
        x_1 \mathrel{\overbrace{\xrightarrow{a_1} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{m-1}} }^{\text{head}}}
        x_m \mathrel{\overbrace{\xrightarrow{a_m} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{k-1}} }^{\text{body}}}
        x_k \mathrel{\overbrace{\xrightarrow{a_k} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_{n-1}} }^{\text{tail}}}
        x_n
    \]
    A pump is <i>simple</i> if every cycle it contains is simple.
</div>

<p>
    An easy consequence of the definition is that every cycle and every lasso is a pump.
</p>

<div class="individual-exercise">
    <b>(Lil Pump in the Country)</b>
    Explain why every cycle is a lasso and every lasso is a pump.

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Loop-de-loop)</b>

    Is every simple lasso a simple pump?

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Find the Pump)</b>
    Consider the state diagram below. 
    <div class="figure">

        <li>Verify that every path of length \(\ge 4\) starting from \(x_0\) is a pump.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<h2>Pumping Lengths</h2>

<p>
    Something happened in that last exercise.
    Did you catch it?
    There was a particular number, namely \(4\), where any path of length at least \(4\) contained a pump.
    This number is pretty special, so we're going to write it down in a definition.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Pumping Lengths for Automata)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A\) be an automaton (not necessarily finite) with a state \(x\). 
    A number \(\ell \in \mathbb N\) is called a <i>pumping length for \(x\)</i> if every path of length \(\ge \ell\) starting from \(x\) is a pump.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Finding Pumping Lengths)</b>
    Find a pumping length for each state in each of the following automata.
    <ol>
        <li><div class="figure">
            <img src="../imgs/kleenealgebraeg.svg" />
        </div></li>
        <li><div class="figure">

        <li><div class="figure">
            <img src="../imgs/reach.svg" />
        </div></li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>
    We haven't said explicitly that every state in every automaton has a pumping length.
    This is kind of the point! 
    Not every one will!
</p>

<div class="lemma">
    <b>(Pumping, for Automata)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A\) be a finite automaton with a state \(x\). 
    Then \(x\) has a pumping length.
</div>

<div class="problem">
    <b>(Finite, Pumped)</b>
    Prove that for any finite automaton \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) and any state \(x \in Q\), there is at least one \(\ell\) such that \(\ell\) is a pumping length for \(x\).
</div>

<p>
    This establishes that pumping lengths exist for finite automata (in fact, you just wrote one down explicitly for each finite automaton!).
    Now what does this have to do with languages?
    There is also a notion of pumping length for languages.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Pumping Lengths for Languages)</b>
    Let \(L \subseteq A^*\) be a language.
    A number \(\ell \in \mathbb N\) is a <i>pumping length for \(L\)</i> if for any word \(w \in L\) such that \(|w| \ge \ell\), there exist three words \(u,p,v \in A^*\) that satisfy the following properties:
    <ol>
        <li>The word \(p\), called the <i>body</i>, is nonempty \[p \neq \varepsilon\]</li>
        <li>Together with the body, the words \(u\) and \(v\), called the <i>head</i> and <i>tail</i> respectively, satisfy \[w = upv\]</li>
        <li>The length of the head and body does not exceed \(\ell\), i.e., \[|up| \le \ell\]</li>
        <li>For </li>
