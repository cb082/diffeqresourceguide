<h1>Finitely Recognizable Languages</h1>

<p>
    Brzozowski's Fixed Point Theorem tells us that every language is accepted by <i>some</i> state of <i>some</i> automaton.
    One issue with this theorem is that it doesn't tell you <i>how big</i> that automaton might be. 
    In fact, it could be infinite for all we know!
    But something very special happened when we

    <b>(Language Families, Finitely Recognizable)</b>
    A <i>family of languages</i> is a set of languages \(\mathsf{Fam} \subseteq 2^{A^*}\) over a fixed alphabet of input letters \(A\).
    We are concerned with the following families of languages:
    <ul>
        <li>
            A language \(L\subseteq A^*\) is <i>finitely recognizable</i> if there is a finite automaton \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) (i.e., \(Q\) is finite) and a state \(x \in Q\) such that \(L = \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\).
            The family of finitely recognizable languages is
            \[
                \mathsf{Fin} = \big\{ L \subseteq A^* \mid \text{\(L\) is finitely recognizable} \big\}
            \]
        </li>
        <li>
            A language \(L\subseteq A^*\) is <i>deterministic finitely recognizable</i> if there is a deterministic finite automaton \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) and a state \(x \in Q\) such that \(L = \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\).
            The family of deterministic finitely recognizable languages is
            \[
                \mathsf{DFin} = \big\{ L \subseteq A^* \mid \text{\(L\) is deterministic finitely recognizable} \big\}
            \]
        </li>
        <li>
            A language \(L\subseteq A^*\) is <i>total deterministic finitely recognizable</i> if there is a total deterministic finite automaton \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) and a state \(x \in Q\) such that \(L = \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\).
            The family of total deterministic finitely recognizable languages is
            \[
                \mathsf{TDFin} = \big\{ L \subseteq A^* \mid \text{\(L\) is total deterministic finitely recognizable} \big\}
            \]
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    Something you should notice immediately: every total deterministic automaton is a deterministic automaton, and every deterministic automaton is an automaton. 
    This means implies that 
    \[
        \mathsf{TDFin} \subseteq \mathsf{DFin} \subseteq \mathsf{Fin}
    \]
    right off the bat!
