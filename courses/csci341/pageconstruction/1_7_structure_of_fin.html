<h1>The Structure of \(\mathsf{Fin}\)</h1>

<p>
    So far, we have seen that if a language is totally deterministically finitely recognizable, deterministically finitely recognizable, or finitely recognizable, then it is all three.
    That is, 
    \[
        \mathsf{TDFin} = \mathsf{DFin} = \mathsf{Fin}
    \]
    This has a ton of very interesting consequences for the <i>structure</i> of \(\mathsf{Fin}\).
    In particular, \(\mathsf{Fin}\) is <i>closed</i> under a number of common set-operations.

    <b>(Flip the Switch 1)</b>
    Draw a state diagram of the two-state automaton \(\mathcal A = (\{x_0, x_1\}, \{a, b\}, \{(x_0, a, x_1), (x_1, a, x_0)\}, \{x_1\})\).
    <ol>
        <li>Is \(\mathcal A\) deterministic or total?</li>
        <li>What language is accepted by the state \(x_0\)?</li>
        <li>Now <i>flip</i> the states, set \(F = \{x_0\}\) instead. Now what language is accepted by the state \(x_0\)?</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Flip the Switch 2)</b>
    Draw a total deterministic automaton with a state that accepts the following language over the alphabet \(A = \{1\}\).
    \[
        L = \{w \in A^* \mid \text{\(|w|\) is a multiple of \(3\)}\}
    \]
    Change \(F\) in this automaton so that the same state accepts 
    \[
        A^* \setminus L = \{w \in A^* \mid \text{\(|w|\) is not a multiple of \(3\)}\}
    \]

<div>
    <b>(Flip the Switch 3?)</b>
    Now consider the following automaton \[
        \mathcal A = (\{x_0, x_1, x_2\}, \{a\}, \{
                (x_0, a, x_1), (x_0, a, x_2)
            \},
            \{x_0\})
    \]
    <ol>
        <li>Draw a state diagram for \(\mathcal A\).</li>
        <li>Is \(\mathcal A\) total or deterministic?</li>
        <li>What language \(L\) does \(x_0\) accept?</li>
        <li>Play the same trick as in Flip the Switch 1 and 2 to make \(x_0\) accept \(A^* \setminus L\). Did it work? What language does \(x_0\) accept now?</li>
        <li>What makes the trick work?</li>
    </ol>
