<h1>The Structure of \(\mathsf{Fin}\)</h1>

<p>
    So far, we have seen that if a language is totally deterministically finitely recognizable, deterministically finitely recognizable, or finitely recognizable, then it is all three.
    That is, 
    \[
        \mathsf{TDFin} = \mathsf{DFin} = \mathsf{Fin}
    \]
    This has a ton of very interesting consequences for the <i>structure</i> of \(\mathsf{Fin}\).
    In particular, \(\mathsf{Fin}\) is <i>closed</i> under a number of common set-operations.

    Draw a state diagram of the two-state automaton \(\mathcal A = (\{x_0, x_1\}, \{a, b\}, \{(x_0, a, x_1), (x_1, a, x_0)\}, \{x_1\})\).
    
    Consider the automaton below.
