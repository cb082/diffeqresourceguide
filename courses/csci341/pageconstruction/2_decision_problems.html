Decision problems versus computation problems:
A computational problem asks for an input/output procedure (a function) that adheres to some specification. A solution to a decision problem is such a procedure.
A decision problem is a computation problem where the output is True or False (typically represented as 1 or 0).
Decision problems are the central focus of this course.
Why we study decision problems in theory of computation:
Many computation problems can be translated into decision problems
Decision problems are simple to describe, and in practice solutions typically achieve more general computational tasks along the way.
Our goal will be to discover the limitations of different forms of computation, and these limitations are already visible for decision problems.
