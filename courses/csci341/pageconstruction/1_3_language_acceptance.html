<h1>Language Acceptance</h1>

<p>
    Today, we are going to return to the idea behind a <i>solution space</i>, which had to do with being able to move our puzzles into a "winning position".
    The "winning positions" of automata are the <i>accepting states</i>, the \(x \in F\), and the legal moves are the transitions. 
    So the "solution space" of an automaton is, so to speak, the sequences of input letters that transition whichever state you start from to an accepting state.
    This is all modelled formally below:
