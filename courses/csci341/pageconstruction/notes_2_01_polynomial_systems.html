<h1>Solving Polynomial Systems</h1>

<p>
    Last time, we saw that a couple of very simple languages... balancing parentheses, same amounts of \(a\)s as \(b\), etc... are nonregular! 
    By Kleene's Theorem, this amounts to the statement that there is no state in any finite automaton that accepts them (how rude!).
    The general slogan you hear people say about these languages is that they "require memory to recognize".
    This is true (and in a precise sense), but I think it is much easier to understand these languages from a systems-of-equations perspective.
    So that's what we are going to do today.

    Let's return to the language 
    \[
        L = \{a^n b^n \mid n \in \mathbb N\}
    \]
    from before.
