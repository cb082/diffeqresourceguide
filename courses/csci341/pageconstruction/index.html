	This is the webspace for the iteration of <i>CSCI 341 Theory of Computation</i> taught in Fall 2025. 
	Here, you can find course notes, links to where you are supposed to hand things in, and other logistics.
	Below, you will find what amounts to a syllabus for the course. 
</p>

<h2>Syllabus</h2>
<p>
	Firstly, <i>who is your professor?</i>
	My name is <b>Todd Schmid</b>.
	I use both <b>he/him</b> and <b>they/them</b> pronouns.
	You can call me any one of 
	<ul>
		<li>Professor Schmid</li>
		<li>Professor Todd</li>
		<li>Doctor Todd</li>
		<li>Doc</li>
		<li>Todd</li>
	</ul>
	Please, I beg of you, do not call me Mr. Todd.
</p>

<h3>Logistics</h3>

<p>
	Lectures are <i>flipped</i> in this course. 
	This means that, while I will often start a lecture by actually lecturing a little bit, <b>you will be expected to go over the notes for each class before-hand</b>.
	The schedule of readings and topics can be found in the course spreadsheet.

<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>
	This is a proof-based and pretty mathematically inclined course.
	This entails a lot of writing: you will be expected to form coherent passages of text detailing your work towards a particular solution to a particular problem.
</p>
<p>
	You will be working in <b>teams</b> during class throughout the semester.
