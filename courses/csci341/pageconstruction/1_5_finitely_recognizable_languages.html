<h1>Finitely Recognizable Languages</h1>

<p>
    Brzozowski's Fixed Point Theorem tells us that every language is accepted by <i>some</i> state of <i>some</i> automaton.
    One issue with this theorem is that it doesn't tell you <i>how big</i> that automaton might be. 
    In fact, it could be infinite for all we know!
</p>

<h2>Reachability and Local Finiteness</h2>
<p>
    The Brzozowski automaton was most definitely an infinite automaton.
    But something very special happened in the <a href="csci341_1_4_finite_and_infinite_automata.html#unravelling" target="_blank">Unravelling a Language</a> problem:
    the states reachable from that language were finite in number.

    <b>(Generated, Locally Finite)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) be an automaton and let \(x \in Q\) be a state. 
    The <i>automaton generated by \(x\)</i> is the automaton \(\langle x \rangle_{\mathcal A} = (Q_x, A, \delta_x, F_x)\) defined by 
    \[\begin{aligned}
        Q_x &= \bigcup_{w \in A^*} \delta(x, w) \\
        \delta_x &= \delta \cap (Q_x \times Q_x) \\
        F_x &= F \cap Q_x \\
    \end{aligned}\]
    The state \(x \in Q\) of \(\mathcal A\) is called <i>locally finite</i> if \(Q_x\) is finite, i.e., \(\langle x \rangle_{\mathcal A}\) is a finite automaton. 
    The automaton \(\mathcal A\) is called <i>locally finite</i> if every state \(x \in Q\) is locally finite. 
</div>

<p>
    Above, the notation \(\bigcup_{w \in A^*} \delta(x, w)\) is shorthand notation for the set 
    \[
        \bigcup_{w \in A^*} \delta(x, w) = \{y \mid \text{there is a word \(w \in A^*\) such that \(y \in \delta(x, w)\)}\}
    \]
    The definition of \(\delta_x\) just says that \(\delta\)
    Note that \(\langle x \rangle_{\mathcal A}\) has the same alphabet as \(\mathcal A\).

    <b>(Reverse Naturals Again)</b>
    Remember that the Reverse Naturals automaton was defined by \(Q = \mathbb N\), \(A = \{l\}\), and \(n + 1 \xrightarrow{l} n\) for all \(n \in Q\).
    Is the Reverse Naturals automaton locally finite?

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Can't...draw...them...all...)</b>
    Write down an automaton that is not locally finite.

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Reachable = Generated)</b>
    Let \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) be an automaton and let \(x \in Q\) be a state. 
    Convince yourself of the following three statements: 
    <ol>
        <li>
            \(Q_x = \{ y \in Q \mid \text{there is a path \(x \xrightarrow{a_1} x_1 \xrightarrow{a_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{a_n} y\) in \(\mathcal A\)} \}\)
        </li>
        <li>
            for any \(y,z \in Q_x\), \(y \xrightarrow{a} z\) in \(\mathcal A\) if and only if \(y \xrightarrow{a} z\) in \(\langle x \rangle_{\mathcal A}\)
        </li>
        <li>
            for any \(y \in Q_x\), \(y\in F\) if and only if \(y \in F_x\)
        </li>
    </ol>
    Explain why this implies that \(\mathcal L(\mathcal A, x) = \mathcal L(\langle x \rangle_{\mathcal A}, x)\).
    <div class="hint">
        Remember that to prove a statement like "\(P\) if and only if \(Q\)", you need to write two separate proofs: you need to prove (1) that "if \(P\), then \(Q\)", and (2) that "if \(Q\), then \(P\)".

    <b>(Language Families, Finitely Recognizable)</b>
    A <i>family of languages</i> is a set of languages \(\mathsf{Fam} \subseteq 2^{A^*}\) over a fixed alphabet of input letters \(A\).
    We are concerned with the following families of languages:
    <ul>
        <li>
            A language \(L\subseteq A^*\) is <i>finitely recognizable</i> if there is a finite automaton \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) (i.e., \(Q\) is finite) and a state \(x \in Q\) such that \(L = \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\).
            The family of finitely recognizable languages is
            \[
                \mathsf{Fin} = \big\{ L \subseteq A^* \mid \text{\(L\) is finitely recognizable} \big\}
            \]
        </li>
        <li>
            A language \(L\subseteq A^*\) is <i>deterministic finitely recognizable</i> if there is a deterministic finite automaton \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) and a state \(x \in Q\) such that \(L = \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\).
            The family of deterministic finitely recognizable languages is
            \[
                \mathsf{DFin} = \big\{ L \subseteq A^* \mid \text{\(L\) is deterministic finitely recognizable} \big\}
            \]
        </li>
        <li>
            A language \(L\subseteq A^*\) is <i>total deterministic finitely recognizable</i> if there is a total deterministic finite automaton \(\mathcal A = (Q, A, \delta, F)\) and a state \(x \in Q\) such that \(L = \mathcal L(\mathcal A, x)\).
            The family of total deterministic finitely recognizable languages is
            \[
                \mathsf{TDFin} = \big\{ L \subseteq A^* \mid \text{\(L\) is total deterministic finitely recognizable} \big\}
            \]
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    Something you should notice immediately: every total deterministic automaton is a deterministic automaton, and every deterministic automaton is an automaton. 
    This means implies that 
    \[
        \mathsf{TDFin} \subseteq \mathsf{DFin} \subseteq \mathsf{Fin}
    \]
    right off the bat!
