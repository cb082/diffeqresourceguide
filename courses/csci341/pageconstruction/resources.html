<h3>LaTeX</h3>

<p>
    There are many resources out there for LaTeX. 
    If you are getting started with LaTeX for the first time, then I would highly recommend Overleaf's online LaTeX documentation and editor.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn" target="_blank">
        Overleaf Documentation
    </a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" target="_blank">
        Overleaf Main Site
    </a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    The only issue with Overleaf's online editor is that you will be working with groups of more than 2 for most of the course, and the free version only allows for 2 editors per document.
</p>

<p>
    Because it's (1) better practice and (2) cooler and (3) free, I recommend using Git(Lab/Hub) to manage your collaboration instead of an online editor.
    For reference, I compile all of my .tex using pdflatex.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/get/" target="_blank">Install LaTeX locally</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://gitlab.bucknell.edu/" target="_blank">Bucknell GitLab</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    If you really insist on an online editor, and you don't want to pay for Overleaf, I've searched around a bit and found these free alternatives to Overleaf:
